# _Not the Rensselaer Handbook_

This is the _Not the Rensselaer Handbook_ (NtRH), a guide to RPI written by Steve Staton, Tom White, and others in the mid-1980s.

This version was captured from a 2016 snapshot on [www.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809181640/http://www.deltos.com/reference/not-handbook/NtRH.html). While there have been other attempts to archive the contents in wikis other formats, the goal of this project is to produce a more permanent version that is easier to read and navigate.
